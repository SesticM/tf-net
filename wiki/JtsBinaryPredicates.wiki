#summary TF.NET Binary Predicates

JTS supports a complete set of binary predicates. Binary predicate methods take two Geometries as arguments and return a boolean indicating whether the Geometries have the named spatial relationship. The relationships supported are `equals`, `disjoint`, `intersects`, `touches`, `crosses`, `within`, `contains`, `overlaps`. Also, the general relate operator is supported. relate can be used to determine the Dimensionally Extended 9 Intersection Matrix (DE-9IM) which completely describes the relationship of two Geometries. 

The algorithm used for computing Binary Predicates in JTS is robust, and is not subject to dimensional collapse problems. 

For Example:

|| Two Geometries to compare || The Binary Predicates || The DE-9IM returned by relate ||
