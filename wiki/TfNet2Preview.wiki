#summary TF.NET 2.0 (Alpha) Preview

== Introduction ==

TF.NET 2.0 is intended to be a J# port of JTS Topology Suite and JTS Conflation Suite products for .NET, in their latest versions. It's still in Alpha and needs to be thoroughly tested against certain disrepancies between genric (Sun) and Microsoft J# Java language implementations. Moreover, it's port of generic Java source and doesn't ressemble to NTS imlementation. Currently TF.NET 2.0 contains only JTS Topology Suite 1.8.0 classes.

TF.NET 2.0 (Alpha) library can be downloaded using following [http://tf-net.googlecode.com/files/TF_NET_2_ALPHA.zip link].


== Prerequisites ==

If you intend to reference TF.NET 2.0 libraries via your VB.NET or C# project, you will also need to reference `vjslib.dll` file which is part of J# Redistributable Package.

Microsoft J# Redistributable Package can be freely downloaded from [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vjsharp/bb188598.aspx Visual J# Developer Center]. Just pick an appropriate version depending on a .NET redistributable you are currently using.


== Limitations ==

None know yet. It should be tested for `Clonable` and `SoftReference` types where implemented, though.
