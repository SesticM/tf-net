#Building Topology Framework .NET From Source

= Building TF.NET on Windows =

TF.NET consists of a single Core library accompanied by number of Reader/Writer libraries. Building Core library is rather straightforward since it's dependant on .NET 2.0 Framework only. It is Readers/Writers you should understand a bit more in-depth.
TF.NET Readers/Writers are separate libraries, each depending on it's underlying platform/API. To be able to build specific Reader/Writer you need to reference necessary files not found in the SVN Trunk due to the possible copyright issues.

== SVN Folder Structure ==

A short guide to folder structure found in a Trunk:

  * `..\Src` - contains source code and project file(s)
  * `..\Inc` - keeps referenced (external) libraries, contains References.txt file explaining which ones
  * `..\Bin` - build target, that's where compiled files end up

== Building TF.NET Core libraries ==

  1. Open and build Core.sln solution first
  2. Compiled files end up in ..\Core\Bin folder
  3. Run TF-MERGE.bat to link them into a single Topology.dll using VS.NET ILMerge.exe tool
