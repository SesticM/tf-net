#summary TF.NET and JTS Spatial Data Types

The most used taxonomy to characterize the problems of spatial analysis
consider three types of data:

  * *Events or point patterns* – phenomena expressed through occurrences
identified as points in space, denominated point processes. Some examples
are: crime spots, disease occurrences, and the localization of vegetal species.
  * *Continuous surfaces* – estimated from a set of field samples that can be
regularly or irregularly distributed. Usually, this type of data results from
natural resources survey, which includes geological, topographical,
ecological, phitogeographic, and pedological maps.
  * Areas with Counts and Aggregated Rates – means data associated to
population surveys, like census and health statistics, and that are originally
referred to individuals situated in specific points in space. For
confidentiality reasons these data are aggregated in analysis units, usually
delimited by closed polygons (census tracts, postal addressing zones,
municipalities).

JTS provides the following spatial data types, according to whom TF.NET provides specialized external API readers/writers:

|| *Point* || *MultiPoint* ||

As per the OpenGIS Consortium's [http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=829 Simple Features Specification for SQL], geometries in JTS possess an `Interior`, a `Boundary`, and an `Exterior`.
