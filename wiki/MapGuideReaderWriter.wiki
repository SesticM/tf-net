References MapGuide Server's `MapGuideDotNetApi.dll` library, which in turn references other unmanaged libraries. All necessary support libraries are available for download [http://download.osgeo.org/mapguide/releases/1.2.0/mapguide-1.2.0.tar.gz here].

If you already have any running version of MapGuide Server (either OSS or Enterprise), you can simply reference it's libraries found in `..\WebServerExtensions\www\mapviewernet\bin` folder, rather than downloading full set of binaries using link above.
