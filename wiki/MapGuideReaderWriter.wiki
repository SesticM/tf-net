#summary TF.NET Reader/Writer for MapGuide

= Introduction =

A reader/writer for geometric primitives exposed by OSGeo MapGuide Server. 


= Components =

File `Topology.IO.MapGuide.dll` available for download [http://tf-net.googlecode.com/files/Topology.IO.MapGuide.dll here]. Exposed classes reside within `Topology.IO` namespace.


= Prerequisites =

References MapGuide Server's `MapGuideDotNetApi.dll` library, which in turn references other unmanaged libraries. All necessary support libraries are available for download [http://download.osgeo.org/mapguide/releases/1.2.0/mapguide-1.2.0.tar.gz here].

If you already have any running version of MapGuide Server (either OSS or Enterprise), you can simply reference it's libraries found in `..\WebServerExtensions\www\mapviewernet\bin` folder, rather than downloading full set of binaries using link above.

Also references TF.NET core library available for download [http://tf-net.googlecode.com/files/Topology.dll here].


= Limitations =

Currently can neither read nor write geometries involving curves.
